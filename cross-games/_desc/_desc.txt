App Landing Page + Info Pages





Client wanted to represent his App for customers and designed Landing Page and pages with information.

I converted it to responsive Bootstrap HTML.

Design was created too large (1920px width). I suggested how it should be designed. And we optimized it together to make it look great at any device.

Client received his Landing page, info pages and page with components (styleguide) for future development:

Currently he is working on App which will be available for download from Landing page we created.

Home page:
