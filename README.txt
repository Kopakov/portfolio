Hi guys ðŸ‘‹

I am HTML/CSS developer highly specialized in converting design to high quality code.

I do cool! and I enjoy of result!! ;) I like to create dashboards and websites fully!

I like when all is perfect! I like to find smart solutions!

I create theme based on Bootstrap. You have all components ready. You can easily extend project, change old components, create new ones, change theme with SASS variables etc. I make project scalable.

I use BEM classnaming and components approach. Each component have unique classes and separate SASS file with styles. There are also common classes for typography, colors, backgrounds, states etc.

I use Pug-templating and components have good structure.

I write comments in HTML code. For example, how to add active state to component or how to use custom script etc.

I create simple structure for backend developers. They can easily change components with classes. I use standart form elements where it is possible. Usually backend guys are really happy with my code!

Of course, code is valid, responsive and tested.

In result I get code which I am proud of!!!

Also I write animations. I customize JS/jQuery plugins, work with charts, datepickers etc.

Shortly about skills:
âœ… Sketch/Figma/PSD to HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap 4.
âœ… Pixel Perfect, Responsive.
âœ… SASS/BEM, Pug, Gulp, Git.
âœ… SVG, Retina-ready.
âœ… JS, jQuery, plugins.
